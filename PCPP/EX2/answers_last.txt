1.

The methods Histogram2.increment and Histogram2.getCount need to be synchronized because they read from and write to shared memory in non-atomic manners. The method Histogram2.getSpan does not need to be synchronized because the span of the array stays constant (could be attributed to a final variable).

Done.

3.

Yes, you can, as these operations are now atomic, there is no need for synchronization.

Done.

5.

Itâ€™s generally better to return a snapshot of the data at that precise moment in time, so I syncronized these methods in order to avoid possible mutations while iterating the array.

Done.
